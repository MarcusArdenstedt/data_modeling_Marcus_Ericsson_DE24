# 0. Hospital example

Going back to the hospital exercise from [exercise0, task 1](https://github.com/AIgineerAB/data_modeling_course/blob/main/exercises/exercise0.md), we will build logical and physical data models. This is the conceptual data model after we've added the composite entities to take care of many-to-many relationships.

<img src = "../../assets/conceptual_hospital_ex0_1.png">

a) Create a logical data model using lucidcharts

b) Identify different keys on the various entities

c) Identify child entities and parent entities. What makes them into parent/child relationships?

d) Create a physical data model using dbdiagram

e) Create a few tables manually, insert given data plus some more, and try to manually link foreign keys to primary keys. Can you satisfy that a doctor can work at several departments and several hospitals?


## Solution

a, b)

### Logical model and different key on various entities

***Hospital***
- hospital_id (primary key)
- name
- adress


***Department***
- department_id (primary key)
- name


***Doctor***
- doctor_id (primary key)
- name



Refined with bridge tables to reflect many-to-many
relationships


***HospitalDepartment***
- hospital_id (foreign key)
- department_id (foreign key)


***HospitalDoctor***
- hospital_id (foreign key)
- doctor_id (foreign key)


***DepartmentDoctor***
- department_id (foreign key)
- doctor_id (foreign key)

c)

**Parent entities**
- Hospital
- Department
- Doctor

**Child entities**
- HospitalDepartment
- HospitalDoctor
- DoctorDepartment

Parent entity have primary key and can existe independing meanwhile child entity is depending on a parent entity. The foreign key is linked to the primary key in parent entity.
